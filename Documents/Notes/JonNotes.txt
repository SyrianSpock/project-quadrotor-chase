VARIABLES
{
	// Velocity
		neighbors->neighbors_list[0].velocity[X] // X Velocity (See end of neighbor_selection.c)
		neighbors->neighbors_list[0].velocity[Y] // Y Velocity
		neighbors->neighbors_list[0].velocity[Z] // Z Velocity
		// Warning: Possible to replace X,Y,Z by 0,1,2? (See neighbor_selection.h)
	
	// Time since last waypoint obtained
		// There will need to be a check for the effect caused by the communication lag
		timeWP = data_logging.time_ms - neighbors->neighbors_list[0].time_msg_received (See data_logging.h and neighbor_selection.h)
		// NOTE: NEEDS DATA_LOGGING VARIABLE !!!
	
	// Previous waypoint
		// Will have to be stored for non linear predictions
		
	
	// ATTENTION
		A possibility would be to create a new structure containing the information for waypoints:
		- Time since last waypoint message
		- Coordinates for previous waypoints

QUESTIONS
{
	In track_following.c - void track_following_get_waypoint(track_following_t* track_following)
		Why is the sqrt called each time instead of once at the end? Avoid overflow?
	
	Is there supposed to be one waypoint only?
	
	Is the waypoint (neighbor) information sent once every 4 seconds or continuously?
	
	What is the private library folder? Do we use it?
