GPS Signal Following - Mobile Robots miniproject
================================================

Goal
----
The quadrotor has to follow another quadrotor (refered to as target).
The target sends its GPS data each 4 seconds.

Approach
--------
The idea is to use a Kalman filter as predictor to predict the target's
trajectory. The prediction is fed into a PID position controller to improve the
quadrotor's responsiveness.

### Kalman predictor
The Kalman implementation for our case is documented
[here](Documents/Notes/SalahNotes.pdf).

It runs the following steps:
1. Kalman prediction steps: the trajectory is predicted using a constant
acceleration motion model
2. If there is a new measurement
  * Estimate acceleration with BÃ©zier interpolation
  * Run the Kalman correction steps: this accounts for the new measurement
  received to correct the prediction
3. Return the state estimate as waypoint prediction

### PID position controller
This takes the predictor's output (waypoint prediction) and apply a PID using
the already implemented PID controller.

The role of this PID is to project the prediction to a new waypoint that is
further so the quadrotor moves faster.
